## **Semantic Python** - a collection of python tools for **Ontology development** and **Semantic Data** / **Semantic Web**

Modern science relies on collaboration and exchange of data and knowledge.
This exchange of information is far from perfect: In many cases data is not well annotated and hard to understand by machines.

Experiments are often not reproducible in other labs or the wheel is reinvented, because a precise language for scientific experiments is lacking 
and searching in data is very complicated.

Many semantic tools had been developed in the first two "semantic web" phases, the late 90s and early 2000, mostly in JAVA, a confusing programming language that gained some popularity at that time.

**Python** matured nowadays to a "*lingua franca*" in science, because of its elegance and closeliness to written English.

Unfortunately there are not too many mature python based tools for ontology development, semantic (meta-)data handling and annotation.
Also common interfaces for metadata exchange and logic reasoning are missing.
Logic reasoners are behind current speed / size demands and technical possibilities.

**SemanticPy** tries to bridge this gap (and high demand) and tries to develop powerful tools to make working with ontologies and semantically annotated data as easy and convenient as possible.
